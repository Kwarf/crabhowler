This is where I experiment with sound synthesis by writing a very simple CLAP
plugin in Rust.

Follow along by reading the blog series:

Starting from nothing, lots of setup and boilerplate to create a simple
monophonic synthesizer without any UI or adjustable parameters.

This introduced parameters, specifically Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release in
order to create a "proper" ADSR envelope to fix clicking noises heard in the
first part. I also extend it to support 16 simultaneous voices, making it a
_polyphonic_ synth. Still no custom GUI, but the DAW is nice enough to provide
one for us for the parameters we expose.

This added a custom GUI using [egui](egui.rs).
